# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

Fairly confident.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

Fairly confident.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
I still do not fully understand the difference between an Implicit and Explicit return. Why does the difference matter? Are Explicit returns used when you need to store a return value?
